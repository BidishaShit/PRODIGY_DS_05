# Analysis of Traffic Accident Data
# Overview
This project aims to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. By examining various factors contributing to accidents, such as weather conditions, road types, and time of occurrence, we can gain insights into accident hotspots and contributing factors to help improve road safety measures.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pandas
4. NumPy
5. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn (optional, for enhanced visualization)
# Dataset
Obtain a dataset containing information about traffic accidents, including details such as location, date and time, road conditions, weather, and any other relevant factors. Ensure the dataset is comprehensive and includes a wide range of attributes for analysis.

# Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Obtain the traffic accident dataset and place it in the same directory as the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
3. Open the notebook/script and modify it to load your dataset.
4. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting data types if necessary, and filtering out irrelevant columns.
5. Explore the data to understand the distribution of accidents across different factors such as road conditions, weather, and time of day.
6. Visualize accident hotspots using maps or heatmaps to identify areas with a high frequency of accidents.
7. Build a KNeighborsClassifier.
8. Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
9. Analyze the relationship between various factors (e.g., weather conditions and road types) and the severity of accidents.
10. Interpret the results and identify actionable insights to improve road safety measures and accident prevention strategies.
